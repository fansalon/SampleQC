Description: `SampleQC` is an R package for robust multivariate, multi-
    celltype, multi-sample quality control for single cell RNA-seq. Unimodal
    approaches to QC, such as `scater`, may preferentially remove healthy cells 
    from celltypes with extreme QC statistics, introducing bias. `SampleQC` 
    removes this bias by fitting a Gaussian mixture model. The fit is done 
    across multiple celltypes simultaneously, and using robust estimators
    allows it to find the distributions in the (expected) presence of outliers.
